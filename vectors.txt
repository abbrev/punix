List of vectors (auto-ints and traps) to be used by Punix

OSC2 is the base for timers on HW2 and higher. It runs at 2^19 Hz (524,288 KHz).

Auto-ints:

Int 1:	scan keyboard, update key buffer for current virtual console
	triggered at OSC/2^11 (256 Hz)
Int 2:	only acknowledge (write any value to $60001B)
	triggered when first unmasked key (see $600019) is pressed
Int 3:	nothing or clock?
	triggered about once per second (HW1) or 1.4 seconds (HW2) ?
Int 4:	read from and/or send to link
	triggered by link hardware
Int 5:	update timers
	triggered at approx. 18 Hz (this is programmable)
	maximum rate is OSC/2^5/2 (8192 Hz). Note: there are exactly
	(122 + 576/8192) microseconds for each (1/8192)-second tick. Just FYI.
Int 6:	2ND or DIAMOND: off, ESC: reset
	triggered when ON is pressed
Int 7:	send signal SIGSEGV?
	triggered on attempt to write below address 0x120 when write protection
	is enabled

Traps:

BUS_ERROR:	send signal SIGBUS
SPURIOUS:	panic?
ADDRESS_ERROR:	send signal SIGSEGV
ILLEGAL_INSTR:	send signal SIGILL
ZERO_DIVIDE:	send signal SIGFPE?
CHK_INSTR:	?
I_TRAPV:	?
PRIVILEGE:	send signal SIGILL?
TRACE:		send signal SIGTRACE?
LINE_1010:	send signal SIGILL?
LINE_1111:	floating-point emulation
