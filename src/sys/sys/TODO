Punix kernel TODO, in roughly chronological order:

* finish writing process management
	* signals (somewhat working but needs to be finished)
	* vfork (basic functionality works; needs to handle memory, file descriptors, etc.)
	* exec (same as vfork; also needs to handle binary format; this depends partly on the filesystem)

* write device drivers
	* tty middle layer (dev_vt works almost completely)

* write filesystem (log-structured filesystem)

* get a working userland dev environment for "real" computers to work with kernel's conventions, eg, executable bin and lib format

* write and/or adapt a small libc (look into using uClibc)

* write/adapt user-land utilities/applications from BusyBox, Minix, or GNU (or possibly Uzix)

* write instruction emulators to handle instructions of higher 680x0 uP's (find out the true usefulness of this)
	* floating-point emulation
	* bit manipulation
	* more addressing modes
