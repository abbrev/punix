bytes in status returned by wait*() routines (these are set in the appropriate
places, eg, in stop(), exit(), psig(), etc)

exit normally:
	[ signal ] [ exit status ] // signal == 0
killed by signal:
	[ signal ] [ exit status ] // exit status == 0
stop by signal:
	[ signal ] [ 0x7f ]
continued:
	[ 0xff ] [ 0xff ]
