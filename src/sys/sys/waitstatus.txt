bytes in status returned by wait*() routines (these are set in the appropriate
places, eg, in stop(), exit(), psig(), etc)

format:
	[ exit status ] [C] [ type ]
	exit status/signal (8 bits)
	core dumped (1 bit)
	type (7 bits):
	  0 = exit normally
	  1 = terminated by signal
	  2 = stopped by signal
	  3 = continued
