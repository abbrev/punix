<h1>Punix, Puny Unix operating system for TI-92+</h1>
<p>by Christopher Williams</p>

<h2>General information</h2>

<p>Punix is a Unix-like operating system for the TI-89 and TI-92+, but primarily for the TI-92+. Its features will (or may) include:</p>

<ul>
<li>True preemptive multitasking</li>
<li>Audio output via the link port</li>
<li>Data I/O via the link port (which will allow a user program to send/receive variables to and from other types of calculators)</li>
<li>60&times;20 virtual terminals</li>
<li>Filesystem on the FlashROM</li>
<li>Floating-point emulation</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

<p>The Punix kernel is a standard monolithic kernel design, similar to the BSD's and clones. I'm using a lot of code from 2.11BSD, 4.4BSD-Lite, V6/V7 UNIX, Linux, UZIX, and Minix (in that order of amount of code, it seems), and I'm structuring the source tree somewhat similar to BSD, so if you understand that you probably can understand my kernel.</p>

<p>The kernel is nearly complete as of this writing. Preemptive scheduling works fairly well, and the terminal is usable. Processes can spawn new processes using the <code>vfork()</code> and <code>execve()</code> system calls. The file system is the last major feature that is still largely incomplete. Because of the missing file system, <code>execve()</code> currently understands a few hard-coded command names (eg, "sh" and "top"). Work is underway to develop the file system and remove this final obstacle.</p>

<h2>Building Punix</h2>

<p>To build Punix you will need <a href="http://trac.godzil.net/gcc4ti/">GCC4TI</a> (last I checked, TIGCC has unfixed bugs in the official release which renders Punix unusable) and <a href="http://members.chello.at/gerhard.kofler/kevin/ti89prog/flashosa.zip">flashos.a</a>. Just unzip flashosa.zip into the directory $TIGCC/lib after installing GCC4TI, and GCC4TI will automatically find it there. Also, a Unix-like environment is prefered because of the use of makefiles and the Netpbm image utilities. You may have luck using MSYS or Cygwin, but these are not supported.</p>

<p>To build Punix, go to the Punix root directory (the one that contains the src and tools directories, among others) in a shell and run <code>make</code>. This will build the kernel for all supported platforms (currently TI-92+ and TI-89) and the libraries. Once built, the kernels will be named punix-89.tib and punix-9x.tib. These files can be used in an emulator like <a href="http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tiemu/">TiEmu</a>.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>You will likely encounter problems while trying to build Punix. If you can't solve them problem yourself, feel free to contact me, including as much detail about the problem as you can. It may be an issue I'm familiar with. Good luck!</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p>Here is a general roadmap of work to be done on Punix.</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete the file system in the kernel</li>
<li>Complete the floating-point emulator in the kernel (a non-essential feature)</li>
<li>Port Punix to the TI-89Ti (and add other features like USB)</li>
<li>Build a userland development environment (ie, cross compiler and tools)</li>
<li>Port libraries, tools, applications, and games to Punix</li>
</ul>
