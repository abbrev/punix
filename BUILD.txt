How to build Punix:

In a shell, run 'make' from the Punix root directory (the one that
contains this file). This will build all libraries and the kernel for
all supported platforms. After building, the libraries can be found in
the lib directory, and the kernels can be found in the Punix root
directory. The kernels will be named punix-XX.tib, where "XX"
corresponds to the target calculator (eg, 9x for the TI-92+ or 89 for
the TI-89).

Once user commands and the file system (and associated tools) are
developed, these too will be built and placed into the Punix root
directory.
